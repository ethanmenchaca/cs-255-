Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
     DriverPass was an organization which aimed to prep customers for their driving test. They requested that we design a web application which could support video streaming, give tests, schedule driving lessons, offer course packages, and monitor students oline progress. 
What did you do particularly well? I believe I did well in my UML diagrams. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? I would create a gannt chart for project one, because at the time I didn't know how to. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? The users needs are one of the most important aspects of system design, because in the end the application is made for the user. If the needs of the user aren't met, the project could be considered a failure. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? I analyze a system by first identifying what is reuqired to make the system functional. After the essential steps are identified, non essential aspects such as color design and layout should be addressed.
